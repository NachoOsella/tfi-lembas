# Testing Strategy

## Testing levels

| Level | Scope | Tool | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | Domain policies, services (isolated) | JUnit 5 + Mockito | Fast |
| Integration | Repositories, database interactions | Testcontainers | Medium |
| Controller | HTTP endpoints, serialization, security | @WebMvcTest | Medium |
| E2E | Full frontend-to-backend flows | Playwright / Cypress | Slow |

## Backend testing

### Unit tests

Test domain policy classes in isolation (no Spring context):

- `FefoStockDeductionPolicy` -- pure Java logic
- `CashCloseCalculator` -- calculation logic
- Order number generation, state transitions

### Integration tests

Test database interactions with Testcontainers:

```java
@SpringBootTest
@Testcontainers
class StockLotRepositoryTest {

    @Container
    static PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>("postgres:16");

    @Autowired
    private StockLotRepository stockLotRepository;

    @Test
    void shouldReturnAvailableLotsOrderedByExpiration() {
        // Test FEFO ordering at repository level
    }
}
```

### Controller tests

Test HTTP layer with mocked services:

```java
@WebMvcTest(ProductAdminController.class)
class ProductAdminControllerTest {

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @MockitoBean
    private ProductService productService;

    @Test
    void shouldReturn200WhenListingProducts() throws Exception {
        mockMvc.perform(get("/api/admin/products")
                .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + adminToken))
            .andExpect(status().isOk());
    }
}
```

### Critical flows to test

| Flow | Test type | What to verify |
|---|---|---|
| CUSTOMER registration | Integration | Email unique, BCrypt hash, branch_id null |
| JWT authentication | Controller | Token generation, invalid credentials, disabled account |
| Product CRUD | Controller | Validation, barcode unique, status transitions |
| FEFO deduction | Unit | Single lot, multiple lots, null expiration, insufficient stock |
| Stock entry | Integration | Lot creation, movement generation, available calculation |
| Online order creation (stock validation) | Integration | Buying more than available is rejected (INSUFFICIENT_STOCK) |
| Online order creation (success) | Integration | PENDING_PAYMENT status, snapshot capture, payment creation |
| MP webhook approval | Integration | Transactional FEFO deduction, idempotency, order status change |
| MP webhook duplicate | Integration | Second call returns 200 without side effects |
| MP webhook approved but no stock | Integration | Order goes to STOCK_CONFLICT, no stock deducted |
| MP webhook rejected | Integration | Order goes to PAYMENT_FAILED, no stock deducted |
| Concurrent stock contention | Integration | Two simultaneous buyers for last unit -- only one succeeds (FOR UPDATE) |
| POS sale (with open register) | Integration | FEFO deduction, order creation, payment with cash_session_id |
| POS sale (without open register) | Integration | Rejected with CASH_SESSION_REQUIRED |
| Cash register close (no discrepancy) | Integration | Expected cash calculated correctly, session closed |
| Cash register close (discrepancy, no reason) | Integration | Rejected with DIFFERENCE_REASON_REQUIRED |
| Cash register close (discrepancy with reason) | Integration | Accepted, discrepancy audited |
| Order cancellation (paid order) | Integration | Stock reversed to correct lots, payment CANCELLED |
| Order cancellation (pending payment) | Integration | No stock action, payment CANCELLED |
| CUSTOMER tries to open cash register | Controller | 403 FORBIDDEN |
| EMPLOYEE closes with discrepancy | Integration | Reason mandatory, discrepancy logged |
| Two open sessions on same branch | Integration | Second open rejected (CASH_SESSION_ALREADY_OPEN) |
| Dashboard query | Controller | Correct aggregation, role-based filtering |
| Recommendations | Unit | Rules fire correctly for low stock, expiring, rotation, no movement |
| Error format | Controller | ApiError structure, VALIDATION_ERROR details |

## Frontend testing

### Unit tests (Jasmine + Karma)

- **Components**: rendering, user interaction, state display
- **Services**: HTTP calls, data transformation, error handling
- **Guards**: authentication state, role-based access
- **Interceptors**: token attachment, error mapping

### What to test

| Component | Test cases |
|---|---|
| ProductListComponent | Loading state, empty state, error state, data display, pagination, search filter |
| ProductFormComponent | Validation errors, successful save, server errors |
| CartService | Add item, remove item, quantity update, total calculation, localStorage persistence |
| AuthGuard | Authenticated access, unauthenticated redirect, role check |
| HttpErrorInterceptor | 401 redirect, 403 forbidden, 409 conflict message, 500 generic error |
| CashCloseComponent | Expected cash calculation display, discrepancy validation, close confirmation |

### E2E testing

Critical user flows to cover:

- Customer registration -> browse catalog -> add to cart -> checkout -> view order
- Employee login -> open cash register -> POS sale -> close register
- Admin login -> create product -> publish -> view in store
- Admin -> process order (prepare, ready, deliver)
- Admin -> cancel order -> verify stock reversal

## Test data

- Seed data with realistic products (15-20 items), categories, lots
- Demo users: admin, manager, employee, customer
- Demo branch: "Centro"
- Fake Mercado Pago gateway for dev/test environments
