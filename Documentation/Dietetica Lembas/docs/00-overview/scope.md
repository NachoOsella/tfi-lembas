## Explicitly out of scope (MVP)

| Feature | Reason |
|---|---|
| Home delivery | Only branch pickup. Delivery requires address management, cost calculation, and logistics integration. |
| Fiscal invoicing (AFIP/ARCA) | Exceeds academic scope. Requires tax knowledge, system homologation, and fiscal keys. |
| Mobile native app | Duplicates effort. Web frontend is responsive. |
| Multi-company / multi-tenant | Single business. Branch support is built in. |
| Automatic supplier price import | Requires variable format parsing and approval workflow. Manual entry in MVP. |
| Persistent server-side cart | localStorage is sufficient for the MVP use case. |
| Notifications (email, WhatsApp, push) | Order tracking is pull-based (customer checks status). |
| AI / LLM chatbot | Recommendations are rule-based. Avoids hallucination and infrastructure complexity. |
| Coupons and complex promotions | Only per-product discounts in MVP. |
| Guest checkout | ADR-039: online purchase requires registered customer. |
| Multi-language / multi-currency | Single local market (Argentina, ARS). |
| Branch-to-branch stock transfers | Single branch in MVP. |
| Multiple product images | Single image URL per product. |
| Brands as separate table | brand_name stored as text field in product. |

## Post-MVP roadmap

| Horizon | Features |
|---|---|
| Short-term | Home delivery (manual), persistent cart, coupons, email notifications, multiple product images, branch transfers |
| Medium-term | Rappi/PedidosYa integration, fiscal invoicing, automatic price import, PWA/mobile app, guest checkout |
| Long-term | Multi-company, multi-currency, AI chatbot, loyalty programs, accounting system integration |
