## Key business rules

1. Products have a single sale price. Price history is kept in audit logs.
2. Stock is tracked by lot with expiration dates for FEFO compliance.
3. Online orders require customer registration (no guest checkout).
4. In-store sales require an open cash register.
5. Cash register closing requires counting physical cash and justifying discrepancies.
6. Online payments go through Mercado Pago Checkout Pro.
7. Stock is deducted when payment is confirmed, not when the order is created.
